        My higher education journey took longer than most of the other students. Due to the unfortunate financial difficulties, I had to take a frequent break to work for a full-time job. This situation made me working at 15 different jobs while completing a Bachelor’s degree in mathematics/economics major at UCLA. Although I was not pleased with my situation at that time, I am now thankful that having experience working in various fields grew me and taught me valuable skills.        </p>
        <p>
        I intentionally pushed myself to work in as many fields as possible because I always learned many lessons from each of the new fields that I challenged myself to work at, and the experiences piled up to shaped the better version of me. For instance, when I was working as an assistant chef at a Japanese restaurant, I never knew that this experience would teach me the importance of the details. When I was working as a data analyst at H Mart, I did not know that the advanced Excel experience would explode my interest in an automation program which later changed the direction of my career path to coding.        </p>
        <p>
        My ideas for the career evolved as I experienced more technical jobs. I have realized that each person’s worth is strictly calculated based on how many skills one has. Since then, I have been focusing on improving my weak skills and adding more new skills to my tool belt. I currently work as an interpreter to strengthen my communication skill, and I have been studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python on my own. Also, I have been working on React projects under the supervision of my brother who is a senior front-end developer at Coinbase to have hands-on experiences.        </p>
        <p>
        My previous life choices show that I am a fit candidate who is not afraid to face new challenges, who do not give up, and who enjoys advancing skills via self-inspiration. I understand the importance of staying humble so that I am always ready to learn from others. I have a lot of room to grow. I also have a will to maximize growth potential. If the opportunity is given, I am confident that I can bring many values to your company and have a positive influence on colleagues.        </p>
